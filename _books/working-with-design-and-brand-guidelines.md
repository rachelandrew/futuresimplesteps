Every business should have a set of brand & design guidelines that explain how to keep their brandâ€™s image, visual style, personality and tone consistent across the many forms that the brand will take in its lifetime.

But what happens when you have guidelines to use, but you have no idea how to put them into practice? This Pocket Guide will walk you through how to utilise the brand elements you have at hand, including typography, visual elements (colour, imagery, icons and more) and text and tone of voice, while also giving you ideas on how to create a set of e ective guidelines for your own business.
