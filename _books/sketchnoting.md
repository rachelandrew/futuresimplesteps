This Pocket Guide is about the use of sketching for taking notes and the clear communication of data and ideas.

Kevin demonstrates how creating sketchnotes can be enjoyable and passes on some great tips on how to get started.

Experienced doodlers will learn how to transform their scribbles to notes worth keeping & sharing, whilst complete beginners will recognise that the ability to draw is not a prerequisite to sketchnoting.
