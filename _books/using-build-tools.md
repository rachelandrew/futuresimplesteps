Graphic designers and web developers can offload a large chunk of their mundane work onto a set of tools which can automate away tedious tasks. These tools have offputting names like Gulp, Grunt and Broccoli, but with a little effort, they can save you hours of time, leaving you free to focus on being creative!

This book will teach you what build tools are, how they work, and how they can help you to automate your workflow.
